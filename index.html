                        What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?
                        If you've never done anything related to web development, that's fine, but make sure to say that here.

                    <h5>Response:</h5>
                    I've never really done anything with web development, however one or two years ago
                    is when I began to learn HTML and CSS as a temporary hobby.

                    <h5>Response:</h5>
                    I am hoping to become fluent with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I am hoping to be able to create
                    simple to complex websites with thorough design work and interactivity.

                    I just got married to my wife at the age of 20, so I'm pretty young for having done so.
