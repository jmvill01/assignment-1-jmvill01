		<h4>Assignment 1: Getting Started	-	Date: October 9th 2021</h4>

		<p>
			<strong>Rundown</strong>:
				This assignment went through the very basics of web development including learning Git, GitHub, GitBash 
			and all the tools that we will end up using throughout the term. I found this very helpful as I am now much more comfortable with constant
			use of Git and the corresponding repositories. While learning these tools I often refferred to sources like Git It or even the common Youtube 
			video in order to find what I needed. My guess is that in future assignments, these resources will prove very useful as well.

		</p>

        <p>
            Along with the tools that we will be using, we also learned parts of the coding languages that we will be using. 
			For example, in order to do this assignment we were given a rundown on how to use html. We were also taught some fundamentals of CSS, 
			however that was not as relevant to the assignment and its objectives. Regardless, having gone through the assignment there were
            still hickups along the way. The most serious issue that I had was getting the image to show up on the webpage.
            I had to come back a day later after I had that issue because I really had no idea what was going on. This, however, was solved
            with a simple change of syntax and a relocation of my image file to the directory of the assignment. I will need to
            keep this in mind when doing future assignments as it was a very simple problem of switching a ':' to a '='.
        </p>

        <p>
			<em>Don't forget the small things</em>, that's my more crucial note to my future self.
