			<h4>Assignment 1: Getting Started	-	Date: October 9th 2021</h4>

		
			<p>
				<strong>Rundown</strong>:
					This assignment went through the very basics of web development including learning Git, GitHub, GitBash 
				and all the tools that we will end up using throughout the term. I found this very helpful as I am now much more comfortable with constant
				use of Git and the corresponding repositories. While learning these tools I often refferred to sources like Git It or even the common Youtube 
				video in order to find what I needed. My guess is that in future assignments, these resources will prove very useful as well.

			</p>

			<p>
				Along with the tools that we will be using, we also learned parts of the coding languages that we will be using. 
				For example, in order to do this assignment we were given a rundown on how to use html. We were also taught some fundamentals of CSS, 
				however that was not as relevant to the assignment and its objectives. Regardless, having gone through the assignment there were
				still hickups along the way. The most serious issue that I had was getting the image to show up on the webpage.
				I had to come back a day later after I had that issue because I really had no idea what was going on. This, however, was solved
				with a simple change of syntax and a relocation of my image file to the directory of the assignment. I will need to
				keep this in mind when doing future assignments as it was a very simple problem of switching a ':' to a '='.

				<em>Don't forget the small things</em>, that's my more crucial note to my future self.

			<h4>Assignment 2: CSS Styling	-	Date: October 22nd 2021</h4>

				<p>
					<strong>Rundown</strong>:
					This assignment was challenging in many ways. Having not made the HTML code there was much
					to decypher and filter through in order to understand the website. That being said, once the program was 
					largely understood, handling the styling side of the program introduced its own difficulties. These were things
					like using the right selectors, getting items side by side, positioning them in the right spot and making them responsive
					in order to work with differing viewports. These were eventually solved through continual testing, searching through 
					external resources and reviewing class projects.
				</p>	
				<p>
					I learned alot from this assignment as it helped me understand where the issues arise while styling websites. This gives 
					me an idea of what to think about when it comes to debugging my code in the future. I also learned a lot of new CSS terminology
					that should help expand my capabilities when styling. Along with new terminology, I also managed to really learn some of the 
					basic code involved with CSS.
				</p>	

				<p>
					Previous class assignments seemed to be the most useful resource for completing the project. Having had many different
					topics in CSS at my disposal for review and help, it proved very useful when dealing with issues regarding those topics. 
					While no specific website proved useful during this session, I did repeatedly obtain help from sources like Stack Overflow and 
					wikiHow. These seemed to present relevant issues that other programmers had that helped me solve my own coding challenges. 
					All in all though, I ended up receiving help from a number of different sources. I refferred to these sources particularly when
					it seemed as though I was missing a piece of documentation that might make things easier, and more efficient.
				</p>

				<p>
					The first thing I remember that I had to google was how to make a perfect circle. I was unsure as to how that might work and
					so a quick google search was able to help me out. The second thing that I remember searching was a definition/review of what 
					the different 'position' options were. Having blanked on most of what their functionalities were, the google search was
					able to provide a quick reminder.

			<h4>Assignment 3: JavaScript Implementation	-	Date: November 6th 2021</h4>

				<p>
					<strong>Rundown</strong>:
					This was a much more difficult assignment. Having gone through the process of completing the filter and trying to add and delete 
					items in the DOM, I know what was particularly difficult.
				</p>	
				<p>
					I would say that there were a few things that really stumped me in the course of completing this project. The first roadblock 
					that hit me the hardest was trying to get the posts displayed after having removed them from the DOM. This proved very difficult
					and managed to eat up hours and hours of my time because I didn't quite know the syntax of the code that was needed. Throughout 
					trying to solve the issue, I was consistently being bogged down with the fact that I didn't know the questions that 
					needed to be asked.
				</p>	
				
				<p>
					This is where CampusWire came in to help. After having struggled for hours of my day to figure this problem out, I put up a post on CampusWire
					to see if anyone else had a way that they dealt with the issue. Within a couple of hours I had a couple of great reponses that helped me out significantly. 
					This other problem that proved to be a fairly insurmountable obstacle was getting the filter to properly  function. This problem, however, was a 
					little bit easier as it entailed a lot more smaller problems that needed fixed rather than one big one that seemed impossible to solve. The filter 
					often gave me troubles because I would fix one problem and then be met with another variation of that problem a second later. This was accompanied 
					with numerous occasions where I would think that I had fixed everything, but then having tested one more time, I find another issue.
				</p>

				<p>
					This basically summarizes my experience with this assigment. While a significant portion of this assignment seemed to be in the unknown, 
					the end result was a pleasant sight to see. With many challenges along the way, I found myself more often than not enjoying solving those challenges 
					rather than dreading them.

			<h4>Assignment 4: Node.Js Introduction	-	Date: November 12th 2021</h4>

				<p>
					<strong>Rundown</strong>:
					This was a simple but slightly confusing assignment. While the requirements were short and sweet, I found myself tripping over my own
					feet because of my lack of care for good debugging practices.
				</p>	
				<p>
					This assignment was very simple. The requirements were minimal and we were given largely all of the tools that we needed in order to figure
					out how to solve the problems. But that was a problem for me as I love to make things more complicated than they really need to be. And because of
					this, I ended up spending plenty more hours on the debugging process than I should have had to. My biggest challenges for this assignment didn't 
					necessarily come from writing the code, but from debugging it. Although the typical nested "if" statements often trip me up for no good reason. With 
					some reworking of logic and rethinking my plan of attack a little bit, the coding process was a bit of a breeze.
				</p>	
				
				<p>
					Then came the debugging issue. Once my code started running, I began to see all of the little issues that had popped up in my code. Luckily, for the vast
					majority of issues, they were quick solves that sent me on my way fairly quick. But for some of these issues, I got caught in them like a fish in a net. 
					These issues were things like trying to solve the reason as to why the CSS code and JavaScript weren't showing up for my index.html or my 404.html files.
					Long story short, they were honestly very minor issues. In fact one of them was exactly this:
					"if (res.url == '/index.html' || '/') {"
				</p>

				<p>
					I'll let you figure out the issue in that piece of code. But that piece held me back for probably an hour. This just goes to show that you can never 
					rule out the little things. While you may think your code is perfectly fine, just remember...they are little after all.

			<h4>Assignment 5: Handlebar / Routing Implementation -	Date: November 28th 2021</h4>

				<p>
					<strong>Rundown</strong>:
					This assignment definitely reflected a rocky road in terms of my programming time. This assignment required a significant amount of digging into 
					resources, however they were more so the resources that the teacher provided rather than random google resources.
				</p>	
				<p>
					Throughout the assignment I felt pretty decent about how it was going, however I felt as though I was somewhat uncertain of what it was that I was
					aiming for in terms of output. While coding, I found myself trying to understand what the end goal was for my code. It was somewhat difficult to 
					determine as the code that was being written was specifically for back-end server type logic. Additionaly, I came across a number of situations 
					where my files weren't being accessed as they should. This proved to be rather simple syntax errors, but occasionally left me fairly confused. The 
					biggest challenge yet, however, has been dealing with part 4. The other three parts were walked through in class pretty well, however, part four
					was challenging because of its rather vague instructions and new syntax.
				</p>	
				
				<p>
					From this assignment, I would say that I have learned a great deal about handlebars and routing. As I imagine I should. This helped me clear up 
					a lot of monotonous code that I knew could be thrown out somehow, but didn't neccessarily know how to do so. I also discovered a lot about npm
					and external packages. These are very nice to have learned as they seem to provide great functionalities without needing to code them over and 
					over again.
				</p>

				<p>
					This was an enjoyable assignment as I discovered more what it was that I was aiming for. If I was to acknowledge one important resource for a 
					future self, I would say, do not neglect consulting with others. They often know things you do not, and in this case it turned out to be so.
